# Story Description

**Title:** *GenAI-Driven Migration of Legacy jBPM Workflows to Camunda 7 BPMN*

Enterprises that have adopted **jBPM** over the years often struggle with migration when modernizing to **Camunda 7**, since the underlying workflow definition languages—while both XML-based—differ in schema, semantics, and modeling conventions. A direct one-to-one transformation is not trivial:

* **jBPM XML** follows a proprietary structure, with nodes, transitions, and actions defined in a way tightly coupled to jBPM runtime constructs.
* **Camunda 7** expects **BPMN 2.0 XML**, which adheres to a standardized specification, with richer constructs like tasks, gateways, events, and execution semantics.

This incompatibility forces teams to **manually remodel processes**, introducing migration risks, wasted effort, and inconsistent workflow behavior.

Our project addresses this by building a **GenAI-powered workflow migration assistant** that can:

1. **Parse jBPM XML Definitions**

   * Identify process nodes such as tasks, decisions, events, and transitions.
   * Extract metadata and execution logic.

2. **Apply AI-Based Semantic Mapping**

   * Use a domain-trained LLM to **map jBPM constructs → BPMN constructs** (e.g., `decision-node → exclusiveGateway`, `node → userTask/serviceTask`, etc.).
   * Capture edge cases where jBPM features don’t have direct BPMN equivalents and suggest approximations.

3. **Generate Camunda-Compatible BPMN XML**

   * Produce valid **BPMN 2.0 XML** that is deployable in **Camunda 7**.
   * Preserve workflow semantics (sequence flow, gateways, task types) while adapting structure.

4. **Validate & Iterate**

   * Run schema validation against Camunda BPMN XSD.
   * Compare execution paths to ensure fidelity of migrated workflows.

For the hackathon deliverable, we will build a **prototype migration pipeline**:

* Input: a legacy **jBPM workflow XML**.
* Output: a **Camunda 7-ready BPMN XML**.
* Intermediate: GenAI engine generates the transformation with human-readable explanations of mapping decisions.

This project demonstrates how **GenAI can accelerate digital transformation by bridging legacy workflow engines with modern BPMN standards**. It reduces manual migration time from weeks to minutes, ensures consistency, and creates a foundation for enterprises to confidently move to Camunda.
